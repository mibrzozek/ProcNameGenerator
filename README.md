# Procedural Name Generator

Java program which generates names based on a file with one name per line.

After instantiating the NameGenrator, use the setFileToUse(FILE_PATH) method to set up the source of the proc generated names.
This method fills three arrays with beginning syllables, middle syllables, and end syllables. These are not true syllables, but
rather chunks of a names with lengths of 2, 3, or 4 letters. All beiginning syllables start with an upper case letter. 

This program produces names by stitching together these chunks randomly, sometimes omitting the middle syllable.
